# <Code-Refactor>

## Description

This was a refactoring code assignment utilizing a provided HTML and CSS document to increase the accessibility of the page with semantic tags.

-The motivation for this project was attempting to improve my understanding of altering code to make a website more accessible while strengthening my understanding of semantic tags and the partnership between HTML and CSS.

-I built this project as a way to test myself on the material I learned over the last week and really utilize the hands on experience to better myself and my understanding on the topics of HTML and CSS

-This project solves the lack of accessibility on the webpage, with the use of semantic tags and better organization of the code it allowed us to increase the accessibility of the page to all users.

-I learned how to better use semantic tags and properly lay out a html and css file to increase the accessibility on a webpage for all users and viewers.
